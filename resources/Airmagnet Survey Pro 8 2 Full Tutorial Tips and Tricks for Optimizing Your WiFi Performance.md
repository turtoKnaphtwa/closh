## What is Airmagnet Survey Pro 8 2 Full?
  
Airmagnet Survey Pro 8 2 Full is a Wi-Fi design and site survey analysis software that enables users to predictively model Wi-Fi network changes or design a new network for optimal coverage, connectivity, and performance. It supports Wi-Fi 6E networks on the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, as well as legacy networks on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. It also supports multiple independent site survey projects at the same time with Airmagnet Survey on Demand, a cost-effective way to enable multiple surveyors on a rental basis.
  
## What are the key features of Airmagnet Survey Pro 8 2 Full?
  
Some of the key features of Airmagnet Survey Pro 8 2 Full are:
  
- Predictive modeling: Users can simulate Wi-Fi network changes or design a new network without physically rolling out access points (APs). They can also compare different scenarios and configurations to find the best solution for their network.
- Real-world data collection: Users can perform true end-user experience measurements using AirMapper Site Survey on the AirCheck G3 and EtherScope nXG. These devices collect data such as throughput, PHY data rates, signal strength, noise, interference, retries, loss, and more.
- Heatmap generation: Users can generate heatmaps that provide full visibility of WLAN coverage, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference, throughput, data rates, retries, loss, and more on the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands. They can also customize the heatmaps according to different parameters and thresholds.
- Active and passive surveys: Users can save time by performing active and passive surveys in a single walk-through. Active surveys measure the actual performance of the network by sending data packets between the survey device and an AP or a server. Passive surveys measure the RF environment by listening to the beacon frames from the APs.
- Professional report generation: Users can easily create various professional reports using customizable templates. They can also export the reports in different formats such as PDF, HTML, XML, or CSV.
