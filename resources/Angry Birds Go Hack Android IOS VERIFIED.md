# How to Hack Angry Birds Go for Unlimited Coins and Gems on Android and iOS
 
Angry Birds Go is a fun and addictive racing game that features your favorite characters from the popular Angry Birds franchise. You can choose from different karts, tracks, power-ups, and modes to enjoy the thrilling races on Piggy Island. However, if you want to unlock all the content and upgrade your karts to the max, you will need a lot of coins and gems, which are the in-game currencies. Fortunately, there is a way to hack Angry Birds Go and get unlimited coins and gems for free on your Android or iOS device. Here is how you can do it:
 
1. Download and install the iFunbox tool for iOS devices or any file manager app for Android devices. These apps will allow you to access the game files on your device.
2. Connect your device to your computer and launch the iFunbox or file manager app. Navigate to your device -> User Applications -> Angry Birds -> Documents.
3. Find and copy the file named "highscores.lua" to your computer. This file contains your game progress and data.
4. Open the file with any text editor and look for the lines that say "coins = x" and "gems = y", where x and y are numbers. Change these numbers to any value you want, such as 9999999.
5. Save the file and copy it back to your device, replacing the original file. Make sure you have a backup of the original file in case something goes wrong.
6. Launch Angry Birds Go on your device and enjoy your unlimited coins and gems. You can now unlock all the karts, tracks, power-ups, and modes without spending any real money.

Now that you have unlimited coins and gems, you may wonder how to use them wisely and improve your racing skills. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you become a better racer in Angry Birds Go:

- Choose the right kart for each track. Different karts have different stats and abilities, and some may suit certain tracks better than others. For example, a kart with high handling and strength may be good for a track with many turns and obstacles, while a kart with high top speed and acceleration may be good for a track with long straightaways and ramps.
- Use your bird's special power at the right time. Each bird has a unique power that can give you an edge in the race, such as Chuck's speed boost, Bomb's blast wave, or Stella's bubble. However, you only have a limited amount of power per race, so use it wisely. For example, don't use Chuck's speed boost right before a turn or a jump, or you may lose control and crash.
- Collect coins and gems on the track. Coins and gems are scattered on the track, and you can collect them by driving over them. Coins can be used to upgrade your karts, while gems can be used to buy new karts or power-ups. Collecting coins and gems also increases your score and your CC (cart class), which determines your eligibility for certain races.
- Complete challenges and achievements. Angry Birds Go has many challenges and achievements that you can complete to earn extra coins, gems, or power-ups. Some challenges are based on your performance in a race, such as finishing in a certain position or time, while others are based on your overall progress, such as unlocking a certain number of karts or tracks. Check the challenge menu often and try to complete as many as you can.
- Play the Jenga mode for more fun and rewards. The Jenga mode is a special mode that you can unlock by entering a code or buying it with real money. In this mode, you can use the slingshot to launch your kart at a tower of blocks and pigs, and try to knock them all down. This mode is very fun and challenging, and it also rewards you with coins and gems for each successful attempt.

With these tips and tricks, you can enjoy Angry Birds Go even more and become a master racer. Have fun!
