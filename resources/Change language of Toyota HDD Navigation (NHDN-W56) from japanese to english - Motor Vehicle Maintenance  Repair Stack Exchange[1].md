## Method 1: Firmware Update
 
One solution is to update the firmware of the device with an English version. This may require contacting the manufacturer of the device, which is Panasonic, and asking for their assistance. You can go to [this page](https://www.panasonic.com/global/support.html) and click on the "consumer Support" link[^1^]. There's a link to tech support too, but it may not be very helpful. You will need to provide the model number and serial number of your device, and explain your situation. They may be able to send you a firmware update file that you can install on your device using a USB drive or an SD card.
 
## Method 2: Translation App
 
Another solution is to use a translation app on your smartphone that can recognize and translate text from images. For example, you can download an Android app called "Cam Dictionary", then take a picture of the display, which will translate it from Japanese to English for you[^1^]. Using this method, you should be able to shuffle through the menus to find "settings" and then change the language to English. However, this may be tedious and time-consuming, and it may not work for all the functions of the device.
 
## Method 3: Replacement Device
 
The last solution is to replace the device with a compatible one that supports English language. This may be the most expensive and complicated option, as you will need to find a suitable replacement device that fits your car model and wiring system. You may also need to hire a professional installer to do the job for you. However, this may be the most reliable and permanent solution, as you will not have to worry about language issues anymore.
 
## Conclusion
 
In conclusion, changing the language of Toyota HDD Navigation (NHDN-W56) from Japanese to English is not an easy task, as the device does not have a built-in option to do so. However, you can try some of the methods mentioned above, such as firmware update, translation app, or replacement device.
