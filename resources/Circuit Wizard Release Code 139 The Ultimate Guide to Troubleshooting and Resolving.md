In this article, we will explain what causes this error, how to fix it and how to avoid it in the future.
 
## What Causes the Release Code 139 Error?
 
The release code 139 error is caused by a mismatch between the license key and the computer ID of your device. This can happen for several reasons, such as:
 
- You have installed Circuit Wizard on a different computer than the one you originally activated it on.
- You have changed some hardware components of your computer, such as the hard drive or the motherboard.
- You have reinstalled or upgraded your operating system.
- You have used a registry cleaner or a similar program that may have altered some registry entries related to Circuit Wizard.

When any of these situations occur, the software detects that your computer ID has changed and assumes that you are trying to use it on an unauthorized device. Therefore, it displays the release code 139 error and prevents you from accessing its features.
 
## How to Fix the Release Code 139 Error?
 
The easiest way to fix the release code 139 error is to contact the customer support of Circuit Wizard and request a new license key. You will need to provide them with your original license key and your current computer ID. You can find both of these information in the Help menu of Circuit Wizard.
 
Once you receive your new license key, you can enter it in the Activation dialog box of Circuit Wizard and activate the software again. This should resolve the error and allow you to use Circuit Wizard normally.
 
## How to Avoid the Release Code 139 Error in the Future?
 
To avoid the release code 139 error in the future, you should follow these tips:

- Do not install Circuit Wizard on more than one computer. If you need to use it on a different device, you should deactivate it on the previous one first.
- Do not change any hardware components of your computer without deactivating Circuit Wizard first.
- Do not reinstall or upgrade your operating system without deactivating Circuit Wizard first.
- Do not use any registry cleaner or similar program that may affect Circuit Wizard's registry entries.
