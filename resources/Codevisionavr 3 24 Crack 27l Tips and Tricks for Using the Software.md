- CodeVisionAVR supports various data types, including bit, bool, char, int, short, long, 64-bit long, and float. It also supports AVR-specific extensions for accessing EEPROM, FLASH, I/O registers, and bit variables.
- CodeVisionAVR has a fast floating point library that uses the hardware multiplier and enhanced core instructions available in the new ATmega chips.
- CodeVisionAVR has a powerful optimizer that can reduce the code size and increase the speed of the generated program. The optimizer can perform peephole optimization, common block subroutine packing, common sub-expression elimination, loop optimization, branch optimization, subroutine call optimization, cross-jumping optimization, constant folding, constant literal strings merging, store-copy optimization, and dead code removing optimization.
- CodeVisionAVR supports four memory models: TINY, SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE. The MEDIUM and LARGE memory models allow full FLASH addressing for chips with 128k or more of FLASH memory. The compiler handles the RAMPZ register transparently for the programmer.
- CodeVisionAVR allows the insertion of inline assembler code directly in the C source file.
- CodeVisionAVR supports C source level debugging with COFF symbol file generation. The debugger can work with Atmel Studio 7 and AVR Studio 4.19 debuggers and various in-circuit emulators such as AVR JTAG-ICE and AVR Dragon.
- CodeVisionAVR has an easy to use IDE with auto indentation, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, code folding, code templates, bookmarks, etc.
- CodeVisionAVR has an automatic program generator (CodeWizardAVR) that can create initialization code for various peripherals such as ADC, DAC, USART, SPI, TWI (I2C), timers, PWM channels, LCD modules, touchscreens, etc. CodeWizardAVR can also generate interrupt service routines and low power modes code.
- CodeVisionAVR has a graphic library that supports many popular display controllers and LCD modules with resolutions from 84x48 to 800x480 pixels. The graphic library can handle fonts, images, icons, menus, buttons, graphs, etc.
- CodeVisionAVR has a font and image editor/converter (LCD Vision) that can create fonts and images in various formats for the graphic library.
- CodeVisionAVR can be used to compile and upload Arduino programs.
- CodeVisionAVR has a chip programmer that can program the AVR microcontrollers using various programmers such as AVR ISP mkII, USBasp, USBtinyISP, etc.

With CodeVisionAVR you can develop high performance applications for the AVR microcontrollers with ease and efficiency. CodeVisionAVR is a reliable and cost-effective solution for your AVR projects.
