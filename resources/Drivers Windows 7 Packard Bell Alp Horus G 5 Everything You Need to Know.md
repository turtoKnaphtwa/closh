In the Device Manager window, you will see a list of categories of devices. You can expand each category to see the devices under it. For example, if you want to check your graphics card driver, you can expand the "Display adapters" category and right-click on your graphics card name. Then, select "Properties" and go to the "Driver" tab. There, you will see the driver version, date, provider, and other details. You can also update, rollback, uninstall, or disable the driver from there.
 
However, sometimes the Device Manager may not show the latest or correct drivers for your devices. This is because Windows 7 may not have the most recent drivers in its database or may not recognize some devices properly. In that case, you need to download and install the drivers manually from the Packard Bell website or from other sources. This can ensure that your laptop has the best drivers for your hardware and operating system.
