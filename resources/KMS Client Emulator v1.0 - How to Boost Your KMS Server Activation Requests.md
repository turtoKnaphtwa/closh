# KMS Client Emulator v1.0: A Tool to Increase the Number of Activations on a KMS Server
 
KMS Client Emulator v1.0 is a software that can emulate the activation requests of multiple KMS clients to a KMS server. This can help increase the client count on the KMS server and enable the activation of more products that require a minimum number of clients to be activated.

KMS (Key Management Service) is a technology that allows organizations to activate Microsoft products such as Windows and Office using a local network server. The KMS server hosts a KMS host key that corresponds to the product edition and version. The KMS clients connect to the KMS server periodically and request activation. The KMS server activates the clients if they have a valid KMS client setup key (also known as GVLK) and if the number of clients exceeds a certain threshold.
 
KMS Client Emulator v1.0 can simulate the behavior of multiple KMS clients by sending activation requests to a specified KMS server using different GVLKs. The tool can run on any Windows machine that has .NET Framework 4.5 or higher installed. The tool requires a client certificate file that contains the public key of the KMS server and a password to decrypt it. The client certificate file can be obtained from the KMS Client Emulator file that is available online[^2^].
 
To use the tool, one needs to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and extract the KMS Client Emulator file from the internet[^2^].
2. Copy the client certificate file (client.cer) from the extracted folder and paste it in a location of your choice.
3. Run the KMS Client Emulator.exe file as administrator.
4. Enter the hostname or IP address of the KMS server and the port number (usually 1688).
5. Enter the password to decrypt the client certificate file.
6. Select the product edition and version that you want to activate from the drop-down menu.
7. Enter the number of clients that you want to emulate (up to 1000).
8. Click on Start button to begin sending activation requests to the KMS server.
9. Wait for the process to finish and check the status messages on the screen.

KMS Client Emulator v1.0 is a useful tool for testing and troubleshooting KMS servers and activating products that require a high number of clients. However, it should be used with caution and only for legitimate purposes, as it may violate Microsoft's terms of service and licensing agreements.

KMS client
 
On the KMS client side, there are also two areas to examine: the status of the client software license service and the Event Viewer. The slmgr.vbs script can be used to check the status of the client activation and to manually activate against a KMS server. The Event Viewer can be used to check for errors or warnings that are related to licensing or activation.
 
Slmgr.vbs and the Software Licensing service
 
To see verbose output from the Software Licensing service on a KMS client, open an elevated Command Prompt window and enter slmgr.vbs /dlv at the command prompt. The following screenshot shows the results of this command on one of our KMS clients within Microsoft.
 
The most important fields for troubleshooting are the following:

- License Status. This shows whether the system is activated or not. If it is not activated, it will show the reason why it is not activated.
- Product Key Channel. This shows whether the system is using a GVLK or a MAK key. If it is using a GVLK, it will show whether it is a KMS client or a KMS host.
- Configuration ID. This shows whether the system has been configured with a specific KMS server name or port number. If it is blank, it means that the system is using DNS auto-discovery to find a KMS server.
- Remaining Windows rearm count. This shows how many times the system can be rearmed by using the slmgr.vbs /rearm command. Rearming resets the activation grace period and can be used to extend the time before activation is required.

If you want to manually activate a KMS client, you can use the slmgr.vbs /ato command. You can also specify a KMS server name or IP address by using the slmgr.vbs /skms command. For example, slmgr.vbs /skms kms.contoso.com:1688 sets the KMS server to kms.contoso.com on port 1688.
 
Event Viewer
 
To check for events that are related to licensing or activation on a KMS client, open Event Viewer and go to Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\SoftwareLicensingPlatform\Operational. Look for events that have a source of SoftwareLicensingPlatformService or SoftwareLicensingProduct. The following screenshot shows an example of such events on one of our KMS clients within Microsoft.
 
The most important events for troubleshooting are the following:

- Event ID 12288. This event indicates that a KMS client has sent an activation request to a KMS host.
- Event ID 12289. This event indicates that a KMS client has received a response from a KMS host.
- Event ID 8198. This event indicates that a license activation failed with an error code.

The event details will show more information about the activation request and response, such as the product name, product key channel, client machine ID (CMID), activation count, error code, and so on. These information can help identify and resolve any issues that may occur during the activation process.
