# Airspeak: A Guide to Effective Radiotelephony Communication for Pilots
 
Radiotelephony (RT) is a vital skill for pilots who need to communicate with air traffic controllers and other pilots in a clear, concise and unambiguous manner. RT communication can affect the safety and efficiency of flight operations, as well as the pilot's professional image. However, many pilots struggle with RT communication, especially when they have to use English as a foreign language.

One of the main features of Airspeak is that it focuses on the communicative functions of RT communication, rather than just the technical aspects. The book explains the purpose and structure of different types of RT messages, such as departure information, route clearances, position reports, traffic information, distress and urgency messages, and so on. It also provides examples of how to use these messages in various situations and contexts.
 
Another feature of Airspeak is that it emphasizes the importance of pronunciation and listening skills in RT communication. The book provides guidance on how to pronounce the phonetic alphabet, numbers, call signs, airport names, and other common words and phrases in aviation English. It also offers tips on how to avoid and overcome misunderstandings and communication breakdowns caused by noise, interference, accents, or unclear speech. The audio cassettes that accompany the book allow the learners to practice their pronunciation and listening skills with authentic RT dialogues.
 
Airspeak also includes a review section at the end of each chapter, where the learners can check their understanding and progress. The review section contains a summary of the main points covered in the chapter, as well as a quiz and a crossword puzzle. The book also has a glossary of key terms and abbreviations used in RT communication, as well as an appendix with useful information on flight levels, time zones, meteorological codes, and emergency procedures.
