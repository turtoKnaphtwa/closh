## What is Redshift?
 
Redshift is a powerful and flexible rendering software that leverages the power of GPUs to deliver fast and high-quality images. Redshift supports a variety of features such as ray tracing, global illumination, volumetrics, subsurface scattering, motion blur, depth of field, and more. Redshift also integrates seamlessly with popular 3D applications such as Maya, Cinema 4D, Houdini, Blender, and Unreal Engine.

## Why Proteus VFX Chooses Redshift?
 
Proteus VFX has been using Redshift since 2018 and has seen significant improvements in their workflow and output quality. Here are some of the reasons why Proteus VFX chooses Redshift:
 
- **Speed:** Redshift is up to 10 times faster than other renderers, thanks to its GPU-based architecture and smart sampling techniques. This allows Proteus VFX to iterate faster and meet tight deadlines.
- **Scalability:** Redshift can handle complex scenes with millions of polygons and thousands of lights without compromising performance or quality. This enables Proteus VFX to create large-scale environments and detailed characters with ease.
- **Versatility:** Redshift supports a wide range of shading models and materials, including physically based rendering (PBR), hair and fur, skin, cloth, metal, glass, and more. This gives Proteus VFX the creative freedom to achieve any look they want.
- **Compatibility:** Redshift works seamlessly with Proteus VFX's pipeline and tools, such as Maya, Houdini, Nuke, Substance Painter, ZBrush, and Photoshop. This ensures a smooth and consistent workflow across different stages of production.

## How Proteus VFX Uses Redshift in Production?
 
Proteus VFX uses Redshift for all their rendering needs, from previsualization to final delivery. Here are some examples of how Proteus VFX uses Redshift in production:

1. **Previsualization:** Proteus VFX uses Redshift to create quick and realistic previews of their scenes and animations. This helps them to test different ideas, refine their concepts, and communicate their vision to the clients and directors.
2. **Lighting:** Proteus VFX uses Redshift to create realistic and dynamic lighting for their scenes. They use features such as area lights, image-based lighting (IBL), physical sun and sky system, portals, light linking, light groups, and AOVs to achieve the desired mood and atmosphere.
3. **Shading:** Proteus VFX uses Redshift to create rich and complex materials for their assets. They use features such as layered shaders, node-based shading network, custom AOVs, displacement maps, normal maps, bump maps, occlusion maps, roughness maps,
and more to add realism and detail to their models.
4. **Volumetrics:** Proteus VFX uses Redshift to create stunning volumetric effects such as smoke, fire,
fog, clouds, dust, and explosions. They use features such as volume shader,
volume scattering,
volume emission,
volume ramps, 8cf37b1e13
